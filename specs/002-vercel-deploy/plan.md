# Implementation Plan: Free Public Hosting on Vercel

**Branch**: `002-vercel-deploy` | **Date**: 2026-10-31 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)

**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-vercel-deploy/spec.md`

## Summary

Seansai goes public on **Vercel's free Hobby plan**, with its data in **Turso's free plan**.

- **Hosting**: one Vercel project with two services, already committed in `156fa6c`. The web
  pages are served statically by the CDN. The Fastify API runs as one Vercel Function on
  `/api/*`.
- **Data**: the SQLite file is replaced by a shared database. The API moves from `better-sqlite3`
  to `@libsql/client`, which runs the same SQL against Turso on Vercel and against a local file in
  Docker and development. Data access becomes async.
- **Writes**: each source refresh is written as one batch, which is one transaction.
- **Refresh**: Hobby allows scheduled work only once a day. A Vercel Cron Job calls a
  secret-protected `/api/v1/cron/daily` route just after midnight Vilnius time. The in-process
  hourly scheduler stays for self-hosting.
- **Staleness**: on Vercel a cinema is flagged after 27 hours instead of 3.
- **Free allowances**: list responses become cacheable by Vercel's CDN, and an N+1 query is
  removed. Together these keep Turso reads under half of the free allowance
  ([research.md §5](./research.md#5-keeping-usage-free-sc-002-sc-005)).

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript (strict) on Node.js 24, unchanged

**Primary Dependencies**:
- API: Fastify 5, zod, cheerio, fast-xml-parser. **`@libsql/client` replaces `better-sqlite3`.**
- Web: unchanged.
- Hosting: Vercel Services (Beta, all plans), Vercel Cron Jobs, Turso Cloud
  ([research.md §1–§3](./research.md)).

**Storage**:
- Vercel: Turso (libSQL, SQLite-compatible), Free plan, EU region. Two databases, `seansai` for
  Production and `seansai-preview` for Preview, so a preview can never migrate or write
  production's data.
- Docker and local development: a SQLite file through the same client.
- Tests: `:memory:`.
- Schema unchanged ([data-model.md](./data-model.md)).

**Testing**:
- Vitest for unit and integration tests, now async.
- The existing Playwright end-to-end suite.
- `vercel dev` for both services locally (quickstart §2).
- Manual checks on the first preview and production deploys (quickstart §4–§6).

**Target Platform**:
- Vercel Hobby: static CDN for `web`, plus one Node.js Function in `fra1` for `api` (Fluid
  compute, 300 s maximum).
- The Docker container on Linux stays supported.

**Project Type**: Web application (npm workspaces monorepo: `apps/api`, `apps/web`,
`packages/shared`), unchanged

**Performance Goals** (feature 001's, plus spec SC-004):
- Movie and screening lists in < 2 s on a mid-range phone over 4G.
- First request after the site has been idle (cold start) in < 3 s.
- API p95 < 300 ms at the server.
- Every request takes **at most a fixed number of database round trips**, with no N+1 (research
  §5).

**Constraints**:
- **Free plans only (FR-011)**: Hobby cron at most daily, a single function region, 300 s
  function limit, monthly allowances ([research.md §5](./research.md#5-keeping-usage-free-sc-002-sc-005)).
- Turso: interactive transactions time out after 5 s, so writes are batched. Foreign keys aren't
  enforced, so deletes are explicit.
- Cinemas are contacted only by refresh runs (FR-007).
- Hobby runtime logs last 1 hour, so `/health` and the `sources` table are the lasting record.

**Scale/Scope**:
- Load from feature 001: about 1,000 visitors a day, peaks of 100 at once.
- Data: about 3,000 rows (1.2 MB), one refresh run a day of about 6,000 row writes.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

| Principle | How this plan complies | Status |
|-----------|------------------------|--------|
| I. Code Quality | Lint, format and type checks run unchanged in CI. Cron failures are handled per source and recorded (FR-009). No swallowed errors: a thrown refresh becomes `failed` and is logged. `better-sqlite3` is removed with its types (no unused dependencies). Nothing reaches `main` (production) without a reviewer-agent review, self-review and green CI (tasks T046, T057). | ✅ |
| II. Readability First | Data access stays in `db/` and the refresh logic in `refresh/`. New code is one route file and one `daily.ts`. Non-obvious constraints get *why* comments: the batching for Turso's 5 s transaction limit, explicit deletes because FKs are off, and the entrypoint shim. | ✅ |
| III. Simplicity | Same SQL, schema and language. One client for all environments. No ORM, no Blob, no queue. Additions are justified in Complexity Tracking. | ✅ (see table) |
| IV. Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE) | New tests: config modes, the 27 h threshold, `storeRefresh` (all-or-nothing, review counts), explicit cascade deletes, migration re-open, daily refresh (failure isolation, cleanup order), cron route auth (404 cases), `s-maxage` headers, **`vercel.json` routing and headers** (rewrite order, SPA fallback, CSP equal to the API's, region, at-most-daily cron), and **startup mode** (cron mode never refreshes or contacts cinemas, FR-007/SC-006). Existing integration and end-to-end suites run against the async client. Only provider-side behaviour (Turso migrations, CDN hits, cron firing) is checked by hand (quickstart §4–§5). | ✅ |
| V. Great UX | Nothing visible changes. The stale notice works as in 001, with a 27 h threshold on Vercel. Deep links work through the SPA fallback. Before the first refresh, the existing empty state shows. | ✅ |
| VI. Performance | Budgets stated above. Function and database in the same region. One batch per source refresh. The `freshness` and `/health` N+1 is removed. CDN caching cuts origin load. The load test still gates p95 < 300 ms. | ✅ |
| VII. Scalability | The API becomes stateless: data in a shared store and no in-process state on Vercel, so instances scale without coordination. Load and 10× analysis below. | ✅ |
| Quality Standards | Secrets only in Vercel environment variables (FR-013). The cron secret is compared in constant time and never logged. Structured logs for each source and the run summary. `npm audit` stays in CI. Documentation updated (FR-016). | ✅ |

**Spec-level deviation (not a constitution violation)**: on the hosted deployment, this feature
replaces feature 001's FR-014 ("refresh at least every 3 hours") and its 3-hour stale threshold
(FR-015, SC-005) with a daily refresh and 27 hours (spec FR-004, FR-006). The owner approved this
on 2026-10-31 to stay on the free plan. Self-hosting keeps 001's behaviour.

**Post-design re-check (after Phase 1)**: still passing.
- The design added CDN caching (one header change) and an N+1 fix. Both reduce complexity at
  runtime.
- The contracts add no public API surface: the cron route is an operations endpoint that answers
  404 to everyone without the secret.

### Scalability check (10×: ~10,000 visitors/day, ~1,000 concurrent)

| Resource | At 10× | First to break? |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| Vercel Active CPU (4 h/mo Hobby) | ~40 min × 10 for the API ≈ 6.7 h if uncached; with CDN hits mostly absorbed, ≈ 1.5–3 h | **Likely first.** Upgrade to Pro, or lengthen `s-maxage` |
| Vercel invocations (1 M/mo) | ≤ 2.4 M uncached; CDN brings it well under 1 M | Second |
| Turso rows read (500 M/mo) | Misses are bounded per URL by the CDN, so this grows with the number of distinct URLs, not visitors: ≈ 100–200 M | No |
| Turso rows written | Unchanged; depends on cinemas, not visitors | No |
| Refresh duration (300 s) | Unchanged; depends on cinemas | No (adding many cinemas would be) |

The first bottleneck at 10× is the Hobby compute allowance. The fixes are a longer CDN `s-maxage`
or moving to Pro, with no rewrite. The design doesn't depend on Hobby beyond the cron frequency
and the 27 h threshold, which are config values.

**Structure Decision**: keep the existing monorepo layout from feature 001. All code changes are
in `apps/api` plus the root deployment files. `apps/web` and `packages/shared` don't change. The
draft task list in [docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-31-vercel-turso.md](../../docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-31-vercel-turso.md)
matches this structure and feeds `/speckit-tasks`.

## Complexity Tracking

| Addition | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|----------|------------|--------------------------------------|
| Two refresh modes (`scheduler` / `cron`) chosen by config | Hobby has no long-running process; self-hosting (FR-015) still needs the hourly scheduler | Cron everywhere would need an external scheduler for Docker users. Scheduler everywhere can't run on Vercel functions |
| Cron route with a shared secret | Vercel Cron calls a URL; the maintainer needs on-demand refresh (FR-008) | A public unauthenticated trigger would let anyone make Seansai hammer cinema sites (FR-007) |
| `storeRefresh` batch instead of a transaction callback | Turso interactive transactions time out after 5 s and cost a round trip per statement | Keeping `transaction(work)` would exceed the timeout on large sources and take minutes per refresh |
| `apps/api/index.ts` entrypoint shim | `@vercel/fastify` ignores the configured entrypoint and would pick `src/server.ts` | Renaming `src/main.ts` would touch the Dockerfile, scripts and docs for a platform quirk |
| Full refresh runs inside the cron route's HTTP request (up to minutes) | Hobby has no background workers or queues on the free plan; Vercel Cron can only call a URL. The request comes from the scheduler or the maintainer, never a visitor, so Constitution VII's "not inside a user request" holds. Sources are refreshed in parallel to stay well inside the 300 s limit (research §3) | A queue or background worker (Vercel Queues, Daemons) would add a paid or extra moving part for one job a day |
| Environment-dependent stale threshold (27 h / 3 h) | Daily refresh would otherwise flag every cinema as outdated all day | One 27 h threshold everywhere would hide real failures for a day on self-hosted copies, which still refresh hourly |
