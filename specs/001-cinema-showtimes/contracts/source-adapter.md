# Contract: Source Adapter (internal)

Each cinema data source is implemented as an adapter behind one interface, so sources can be
added (e.g. Vue or Cinamon, once permitted) or fixed without touching the rest of the system.

```ts
interface SourceAdapter {
  /** Matches Source.id in the data model, e.g. "forum". */
  readonly id: string;

  /**
   * Fetch and normalise all published screenings from today up to the source's furthest
   * published date. Must not write to storage and must not throw for a single bad item:
   * bad items are skipped and counted in `skipped`.
   */
  fetchScreenings(context: AdapterContext): Promise<AdapterResult>;
}

type AdapterContext = {
  now: Date;                       // injected for deterministic tests
  http: PoliteHttpClient;          // User-Agent, delay between requests, timeout, robots check
  registry: CinemaRegistry;        // maps source venue keys → Cinema ids
};

type AdapterResult = {
  screenings: SourceScreening[];
  skipped: Array<{ reason: string; raw: string }>;  // logged, not shown to users
};

type SourceScreening = {
  sourceScreeningId: string;
  cinemaId: string;                // resolved through the registry
  startsAt: Date;                  // exact instant (UTC)
  title: string;                   // as published
  originalTitle: string | null;
  year: number | null;
  durationMinutes: number | null;
  ageRating: string | null;
  genres: string[];
  posterUrl: string | null;
  hall: string | null;
  format: "2D" | "3D" | "IMAX" | "4DX" | "ScreenX" | "other" | null;
  spokenLanguage: string | null;
  subtitleLanguage: string | null;
  isDubbed: boolean | null;
  ticketUrl: string;
};
```

## Rules every adapter must follow

1. Output is validated against the `SourceScreening` schema by the refresh job; an adapter whose
   result fails validation, or that throws, counts as a failed refresh. The previous data for that
   source is kept (FR-015).
2. Only paths allowed by the source's `robots.txt` are requested; ticket-sale paths are never
   requested, only returned as `ticketUrl`.
3. Times are converted to exact instants using the source's offset or UTC field; when the source
   gives local time only, it is interpreted in `Europe/Vilnius`.
4. A successful result **replaces** all of that source's future screenings in storage.

## Adapters in v1

| Adapter | Cinemas | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| `mcs` (configured twice: `apollo`, `pasaka`) | Apollo Kinas, Pasaka | Markus Cinema System feed; JSON (Apollo) or XML (Pasaka) |
| `forum` | Forum Cinemas | REST API; screenings per region + movie details per movie id |
| `skalvija` | Skalvija | WordPress JSON with PHP-warning prefix; title/start/ticket URL only |
| `fliko` (configured per site: `atlantis`, `garsas`, `spindulys`, `minija`) | Atlantis, Garsas, Spindulys, Minija | Server-rendered `/filmai/{slug}` pages of the shared Fliko site template; never calls the `back.*` backends |
| `romuva` | Romuva | JSON calendar array embedded in the ticket page; title/start/ticket URL only |

## Contract tests

Each adapter has fixture-based tests: saved real responses in `apps/api/tests/fixtures/{source}/`
→ expected `SourceScreening[]`. Fixtures are refreshed deliberately (by a script) when a source
changes, never fetched during CI.
